# Welcome to VolunteerConnect!

Empowering Volunteers Through Virtual Roleplay Experiences

Our project is dedicated to enhancing essential skills used during volunteer services, such as empathy, patience, and communication skills. Through our roleplay experience on an interactive platform, we simulate conversations with virtual elderly personas, each with their own background, personality, and pressing issues. By engaging with these personas, volunteers can practice and refine their approach to better support and communicate with the elderly community effectively.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Roleplay Scenarios**: Volunteers engage with realistic personas to practice empathy and communication skills, while keeping in mind the language proficiency of the personas.
- **Engagement Prompts**: Each scenario includes engagement prompts to guide volunteers in their interactions.
- **Profile Cards**: Detailed profiles for each persona provide background, personality traits, issues, and training focuses.
- **Results**: A results and debrief providing performance insights and feedback from the roleplay session. Users can also share their results with others.
